"You are a gambling addict. And you love playing games at the casino to earn more money. 
The idle part of the game would be that if you had enough money from playing some games at the casino you can buy the rights to a slots machine or poker table to get passive income (slots machine earns you the least, poker table the most, black jack in the middle, etc, (create a tier list))
When you run out of money you go into the catacombs to find hidden gems and stuff. There will be other people or things (undecided) that will fight you for the gems 
If you die you get a resurrection chance (play hangman - you are the hanging man, if you lose you die) if you win you get to survive but you lose some of your riches
You can upgrade (ascend?) by buying abilities that will increase your winning odds in different games (free spins on slots, start with more fields blocked out on bingo, you can see more of the cards of the opponent poker players, get extra chances in blackjack - you can see if the next card you will pull is over or under 5)
The game goes by days. During the day you gamble, at night you HAVE TO go to the catacombs to earn more money. Catacombs will become larger and harder (stronger enemies). When you die, only then do you get to buy the rights to tables or upgrade your abilities. 
The catacombs aspect could be a timed event. Like once it hits 8PM in the game worldâ€™s time, you just get sent into the catacombs to fight.
